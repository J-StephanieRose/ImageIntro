## Getting started with images in the digital humanities: What tools? Which data? And, most importantly: what questions?

Welcome to the workshop! If you haven't already filled out this form, I would appreciate if you would fill it out: [https://tinyurl.com/dhrx-survey](https://tinyurl.com/dhrx-survey)

## Part 1: Who are we? What are we doing?

- Go over survey results
- Discuss any experiences we have working with images (keep these in mind during the workshop today!)
- Goals of today
  - Check-in: who is everyone? have folks tackled problems from a statistical perspective before?
    - What types of data have folks used? Anyone
  - Understanding images as data
    - Loading images
    - Images as arrays
    - Filters
    - Convolutions as filters
    - Experimenting with image representations
    - Replicating ["Neural Neighbors: Capturing Image Similarity"](http://dhlab.yale.edu/projects/neural_neighbors.html) along with convolutional network introduction
  - Highlight a few other APIs commonly used for image understanding for your toolboxes
  - Highlight a few image datasets
  - Discussion: given the experience today, do you see any applications of computer vision to your own work?
    - What more 
  - If time: Diving deeper into convolutional neural networks

During different parts

## Part 2: Images as data

- Check ["Neural Neighbors: Capturing Image Similarity"](http://dhlab.yale.edu/projects/neural_neighbors.html)
- Download and unzip the files listed on the github page (5K coco images, 5K bl images)
- Open up terminal, and navigate using `cd` to this directory.
- run `jupyter notebook neural_neighbors.ipynb`
- show demo visualization of image space.

## Part 3: Exploring other tools for computer vision

- What other tools exist?
- What other DH datasets exist?

## Part 4: Exploring image datasets: what's

## Part 4 (if time): Convolutional Networks Unpacked

- Visualizing filters/activations
